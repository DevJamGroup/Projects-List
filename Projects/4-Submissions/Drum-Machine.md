# Drum Machine
Tier: 1-Advanced

A drum machine is a device where you can program loops with different types of percussion sounds. A loop is usually 16-step bar long. The user creates drum patterns by placing sounds on a specific step. This creates a quantized beat, quantized means that each sound is placed on time. 

## User Stories
- [ ] The application should have at least 3 sounds to build a loop with, even before the user adds any of their own. A kick-drum, a snare drum and a hi-hat
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to place and remove the sounds anywhere I want along the 16-bar sequence
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to play the sequence of sounds that I have now built
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to put the sequence on loop so that it doesn't stop playing after 1 playthrough, this means that I as a user should also be able to stop the loop.
- [ ] The drum machine should be set to 100BPM

## Bonus features
- [ ]  As a user I want to be able to add a new 16-bar loop with a different sound, that already exists in the app
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to upload my own sounds that can be used in the drum machine
- [ ] As a user i want to be able to change the BPM
- [ ] As a user I want to be able to save a loop sequence that i have built
